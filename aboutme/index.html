    <h2>Atsushi Karino</h2>
    <p>I'm Atsushi Karino from Tokyo Japan. I served in Japan Sapporo Mission from 2018 to 2020, 
        and got married last year! Right now, we are expecting a new family this fall. This is actually 
        my first semester at BYU-Idaho. I am a former BYU-Hawaii student majored in Computer Science.
        Due to marriage, financial thigs, and whole other reasons, I decided to take the online degree program.
    </p>
    <p>My brother is also a BYU-Idaho student. He is not an online student so some of you might know him. 
        Say Hello to Chikara, and tell him to go get married to his crush lol.
